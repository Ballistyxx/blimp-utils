This project draws inspiration and guidance from several open-source libraries. I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to the developers and contributors of these projects.

Specifically, for the sensor interactions, I have referred to:

*   **BMI270**: The implementation for the BMI270 sensor interface was guided by the work found here: https://github.com/CoRoLab-Berlin/bmi270_python, written by Kevin Sommler for a practical project at the CoRoLab in Berlin. The original code is licensed under the MIT license, which allows for modification and redistribution.
*   **BMM350**: The implementation for the BMM350 sensor interface was guided by the work found here: https://github.com/DFRobot/DFRobot_BMM350, which is a library for the BMM350 magnetometer sensor breakout board from DFRobot. It was written by Yonglei Ren for the company DFRobot. The original code is licensed under the MIT license, which allows for modification and redistribution.

Their contributions to the open-source community are invaluable and have significantly aided the development of `blimp-utils`.
